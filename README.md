## 📌 Deployment Notice (Free Render Tier)
**EXTRA SIDE NOTE — Render Hosting Disclaimer:**
> This project is hosted on [Render](https://render.com) using the **Free Tier**, which means:

```
🔄 The site (especially the backend server) may **spin down after periods of inactivity**, causing a short delay (cold start) when it starts back up.

🕒 You might experience a slight loading time **when signing in or registering**, especially if the server has been inactive for a while.

💡 **TIP**: Use [cron-job.org](http://cron-job.org) to ping your backend endpoint regularly and prevent our project from spinning down due to inactivity.
